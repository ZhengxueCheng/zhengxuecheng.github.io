I am currently an assistant researcher at [MediaLab](https://medialab.sjtu.edu.cn/), in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before that, I received the B.E. degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China in 2014 and the M.E. degrees from Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2015 and 2017, respectively through a double-degree program. I received a PhD.degree at Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan in 2020 under the supervision of Prof. [Jiro Katto](https://www.katto.comm.waseda.ac.jp/). I also received the Research Fellowship for Young Scientists DC2 from Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS). From 2018 to 2019, I was a visiting intern at EPFL, Switzerland, working with Prof. [Touradj Ebrahimi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jt-UsrcAAAAJ). After that I worked in Ant Group, Hangzhou, China, as an Algorithm Expert until April 2024.
